Code included in the repository to clean the data:
```{r}

joined_df <- left_join(papers, paper_authors) %>% 
  left_join(authors) %>% 
  left_join(paper_programs) %>% 
  left_join(programs)%>% 
  mutate(
    catalogue_group = str_sub(paper, 1, 1),
    catalogue_group = case_when(
      catalogue_group == "h" ~ "Historical",
      catalogue_group == "t" ~ "Technical",
      catalogue_group == "w" ~ "General"
    ),
    .after = paper
  ) 

joined_df
```
I want to clean this a little further. I am going to use the lubridate package to create an additional column that has both the month and year.
```{r}


```




Brainstorming:

* Join dates into one column using lubridate
* Pie chart of programs
* How did the number of papers change over time for each program?


```{r}
joined_df$month_year <- as.Date(with(joined_df, paste(month, year,sep="-")), "%m-%y")
##This is not working, I'll come back to it later.
```


First, I want to see how things have 

joined_df %>% ggplot(aes(x=year, y= ))

```{r}
cat_over_time <- joined_df %>% subset(select = c(year,program_category)) %>% drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%  count(program_category, sort = TRUE) %>% group_by(year) %>% arrange(year)

#plot over time by program category. 
plot_cot1 <- cat_over_time %>% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, color = program_category)) + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Year") + 
  ylab("Number of Articles") +
  ggtitle("Articles over Time (1)")
plot_cot1
```

Looking at this graph, one of the first things I noticed was the large spike in all papers in 2020, so I went back and looked at the data (joined_df). I noticed some interesting repeat observations. For example, the paper ID w21817 (published in 2015) was listed six times with three different authors, each listed twice. I am not sure why, so I am going to look back at the descriptions. This also makes me realize that the above graph is _misleading and false_, and therefore if I really want to see how many papers were published each year for each category, I need to group by paper ID.

I also realized that it may not be a good idea to drop the NA category completely, because it kind of looks like there were less published articles in a given year, but in reality, we are just focusing on the category

*Starting again*

Here I am selecting the year, paper, and program category and filtering out any repeat observations/any repeat rows that have the same paper, year, and category.
```{r}
#cot stands for category over time. 
cot_id_ungrouped <- joined_df %>% subset(
  select = c(paper, year, program_category)) %>%
  group_by(paper) %>% distinct()

glimpse(cot_id_ungrouped)

cot_id <- cot_id_ungrouped %>% group_by(year) %>% count(
  program_category, sort = TRUE) %>% arrange(year)
```


*Upon looking at this data, I have now noticed that some papers have multiple categories. For example, w0317 from 1979 was both in the macro/international category and had a separate entry for the micro category, I will return to this observation, but first I want to see how the graph differs from the original.*

```{r}

plot_cot2 <- cot_id %>% ggplot(aes(x=year, y=n, color = program_category)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of Articles Published") +
  ggtitle("Articles over Time (2)")

#Let's compare the first plot and the new plot.
plot_cot1
plot_cot2
```

The maximum value on the y axis of the new plot is around 1/6 the original peak, so it seems like a good thing I caught the repetition of paper IDs!

_New questions/thoughts:_

* What about the NA ids? Should I just drop them and have an additional line for total papers?
* How can I address papers in multiple categories? (Note to self)


Another thing I am realizing is- why do we care about the category above? I don't really care on intial observation, so I am going to reroute and try to ask a question that is more interesting but would require the same type of graph as above: focusing on the "program_desc" category is more specific and detailed.

```{r}
#pot = program over time
pot_id_ungrouped <- joined_df %>% subset(
  select = c(paper, year, program_desc)) %>%
  group_by(paper) %>% distinct()

pot_id <- pot_id_ungrouped %>% group_by(year) %>% count(
  program_desc, sort = TRUE) %>% arrange(year)


pot_plot <- pot_id %>% ggplot(aes(x=year,y=n, color = program_desc)) + 
  geom_line() + theme(legend.key.size = unit(0.2, 'cm'), legend.position = c(.4, .8))
pot_plot

```

This is quite busy and therefore not super informative. _How can I strike a balance between too few and too many categories?_ Maybe I will answer this later.

I want to ask a question that doesn't have to do with time. I have worked a lot with 


Another question I have is if there is a year that is a month that is most popular for publishing. This could have implications about the fiscal year and pressure to publish. This could be done with a dot plot, or maybe a series of box and whisker plots. I will try the box and whisker plot.
Actually, since year isn't a discrete variable, I will try something else. 

```{r}
popmonth <- joined_df %>% subset(select = c(paper, year, month)) %>% group_by(paper) %>% distinct()

#popmonth$month <- popmonth$month %>% as.character() #Because the number under "month" indicates a month and not an actual number, It may be easier to work with if it is not read as a number.

popmonth_count <- popmonth %>% group_by(year) %>% count(month, sort = TRUE) 
#^At this point, we have the data arranged by year and number of papers published per month of a given year. I think the best way to 

popmonth_plot <- popmonth_count %>% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = month, group = n)) + geom_count()

popmonth_plot

#This is not giving any information. This is because of the range of years is too vast. I'll just focus on 2010-2020. 

lastdecade_popmonth <- popmonth_count[ which(popmonth_count$year >= 2010), ]

ldpm_plot <- lastdecade_popmonth %>% ggplot(aes(x=year, y=month, color=n, size = n)) + geom_count(alpha = 1)

ldpm_plot
```


I don't like this, it is not informative. I'm going to take a different approach. I think we don't need to look at year quite yet. Instead, let's try making x the month and y the number of papers. We can do this for all data up to 2020, since 2021 does not have papers printed through the end of the year.

```{r}
popmonth$month <- popmonth$month %>% as.character() %>% factor(levels = c("10", "11", "12", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"))
#I am arranging in this order because the fiscal year starts in October (10) and ends in September (9).

popmonth %>% ggplot(aes(x = month)) + geom_bar() + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(2000,3000))


```

This kind of looks like a trend- we can see towards the end of fiscal quarters (every three months), there is a spike in number of papers published.
